# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-for-User-Authentication
In this Facial Recognition for User Authentication, we implement a system to detect face, recognize it and verify it automatically.
• The user will show his live face to camera and his frontal face selfie will be taken. 
• System will detect the face and recognize it. 
• The photo on user ID will be checked and matched with the live face. 
• If matched, the user will be authenticated.
